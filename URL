https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL
A uniform resource locator (URL), colloquially known as an address on the Web,[1] is a reference to a resource that specifies its location 
on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),[2][3] although many 
people use the two terms interchangeably.[4][a] URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages
(HTTP/HTTPS) but are also used for file transfer (FTP), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.
